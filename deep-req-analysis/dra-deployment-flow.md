## Deep Requirement Analysis (DRA) Framework - Deployment Flow

✅ Here’s where we stand
You’ve completed STAGE-0 (Layers 1 → 4) of the Deep Requirement Analysis pipeline.
That means you now have a solid analytical baseline—entities, hierarchy, and relationships derived cleanly from the RAW Requirements.


🚀 Next Steps (for Project Chiron)
Here are your branching options:

| Option                                          | Purpose                                                                                                                               | Output                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **A — STAGE-1 Interactive Review**              | Start the collaborative refinement cycle: each Layer 1–4 chunk can be reviewed, annotated, or edited line-by-line.                    | Locked and version-tagged Section 1.                 |
| **B — STAGE-2 Schema Expansion & Validation**   | Use the validated Section 1 as a *living schema* and expand it into a **complete enumerated skeleton** (all subsections and anchors). | Enumerated, schema-accurate Markdown skeleton.       |
| **C — STAGE-3 Content Population & Completion** | Populate the enumerated skeleton with analytical content for every subsection (visual, behavioral, data, etc.).                       | Fully populated Deep Requirements Analysis Document. |
| **D — Freeze & Export**                         | Package current STAGE-0 output as a versioned artifact (Markdown + Annex metadata).                                                   | `Chiron_STAGE-0_v1.md`.                              |

👉 Normally, the sequence would be:
STAGE-0 → STAGE-1 → STAGE-2 → STAGE-3.

# 🧩 Transition to STAGE-2 — Schema Expansion & Validation

Here’s what happens next:

## 1. Structural Enumeration
I’ll take the validated STAGE-0 content (Layers 1–4) as your living schema and generate a fully enumerated document skeleton that follows the Foundation Schema v2.1 (two-tier guidance system).
- Every subsection and sub-subsection will be listed explicitly.
- All anchors (`<!-- [ENT-…] -->, <!-- [REL-…] -->`, etc.) will be generated dynamically.
- Placeholder text `Not required yet`. will appear wherever the RAW text provided no content.

## 2. Schema Integrity
- Every entity from your approved Chunks will be reflected in Main Objects / Entities, Relationships / Hierarchy, and Behavior & Interactions placeholders.
- Annex-A Tag Map Table entries will be created automatically for all enumerated anchors.

## 3. Deliverable Format
The output will come as copy-ready Markdown Chunks, in the same visual style you approved (Chunk 1 → 4), but now covering the entire enumerated skeleton.
This document will form the structural backbone for STAGE-3 content population.
